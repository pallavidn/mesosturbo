## Overview

Mesosturbo leverages [Turbonomic](https://turbonomic.com/) patented analysis 
engine to provide visibility and control across the entire stack of a Mesos Cluster,
 to assure the performance of running micro-service in Mesos, as well as the efficiency of underlying infrastructure.

Mesosturbo runs as a container on one of the Mesos Agent in a Mesos Cluster.
Once Mesosturbo installed, it establishes communication with your existed Turbonomic server, to provide
advanced application QoS control across the whole IT stack in real time by leveraging Turbonomicâ€™s analysis engine.
